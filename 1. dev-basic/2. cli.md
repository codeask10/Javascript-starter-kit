# CLI Commands for Developers

Command Line Interface (CLI) commands are an essential skill for any developer, especially when working in professional environments. This guide introduces the importance of CLI, its advantages and disadvantages, and resources to help you master it.

## Introduction

The CLI is a powerful tool for interacting with your system and managing tasks efficiently. As a developer, understanding CLI commands can significantly improve your productivity and ability to work effectively in a company.

### Pros of Using CLI as a Developer:

- **Efficiency**: Perform tasks faster compared to GUI.
- **Automation**: Easily automate repetitive tasks using scripts.
- **Remote Work**: Manage remote servers and environments.
- **Resource-Friendly**: Consumes less system resources than GUI-based tools.
- **Advanced Features**: Access to a wide range of commands and utilities.

### Cons of Using CLI:

- **Learning Curve**: Requires memorization of commands and their options.
- **Error-Prone**: Small mistakes can lead to significant issues.
- **Limited Feedback**: Lacks visual cues compared to GUI.

Mastering CLI commands is a critical skill that helps you stand out when joining a company, as most development and deployment tasks involve command-line operations.

## Practice Drill 1

Practice your CLI skills with the following tasks:

### Step 1: Create the Directory Structure

Create the following directory structure (create empty files where necessary):

```
hello
├── five
│   └── six
│       ├── c.txt
│       └── seven
│           └── error.log
└── one
    ├── a.txt
    ├── b.txt
    └── two
        ├── d.txt
        └── three
            ├── e.txt
            └── four
                └── access.log
```

### Step 2: Perform the Following Operations

1. Delete all the files with the `.log` extension.
2. Add the following content to `a.txt`:

```
Unix is a family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original AT&T Unix, development starting in the 1970s at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others
```

3. Delete the directory named `five`.
4. Rename the `one` directory to `uno`.
5. Move `a.txt` to the `two` directory.

### Pipes

1. Download the contents of "Harry Potter and the Goblet of fire" using the command line from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bobdeng/owlreader/master/ERead/assets/books/Harry%20Potter%20and%20the%20Goblet%20of%20Fire.txt)
2. Print the first three lines in the book
3. Print the last 10 lines in the book
4. How many times do the following words occur in the book?
   - Harry
   - Ron
   - Hermione
   - Dumbledore
5. Print lines from 100 through 200 in the book
6. How many unique words are present in the book?

### Processes, ports

1. List your browser's process ids (pid) and parent process ids(ppid)
2. Stop the browser application from the command line
3. List the top 3 processes by CPU usage.
4. List the top 3 processes by memory usage.
5. Start a Python HTTP server on port 8000
6. Open another tab. Stop the process you started in the previous step
7. Start a Python HTTP server on port 90
8. Display all active connections and the corresponding TCP / UDP ports.
9. Find the pid of the process that is listening on port 5432
