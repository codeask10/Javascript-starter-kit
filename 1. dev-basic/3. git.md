# Git for Developers

Git is an essential version control system that every developer should master. It allows you to track changes, collaborate with teams, and manage your codebase efficiently. This guide provides resources and tips to help you get started with Git.

## Introduction to Git

Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It helps developers:

- Keep track of code changes.
- Collaborate with multiple contributors.
- Rollback changes when necessary.
- Branch and merge codebases for feature development and bug fixes.

## Sample Self-Review Questions

- Initialize Git repository
- Add a file a.txt
- Make a commit.
- Create a branch called leaf
- Add a file b.txt
- Create a second commit
- Merge leaf into master

Checking understanding:

- What is staging area?
- Where is the HEAD right now?

## Git Standard Practices

### 1. Using .gitignore

### 3.Making Effective Commits on Git

#### Small Commits

Make small commits. Let's say you got a task. Instead of doing a 1 commit with 100 lines of code, make sure you break down your task into micro-tasks and then commit for each microtask. This creates your work history and at the same time makes it easier for you to go back to a point where you wrote code that works.

For example, you wrote a function that is working. But you wanted to improve it further. So while improving you realized what you wrote, in the beginning, is actually better. Now in this case, if you don't have a commit history, you won't get the code you wrote in the beginning.

#### Commit Often

Keep committing after every micro-task, don't commit at the end of the day. You will lose a lot of work history. If you use Pomodoro, then make a habit of committing after every Pomodoro.

#### Commit Working Code

Make sure you always commit working code. Never commit something that breaks the codebase. What I mean by this is for example you wrote a function/method for your task that is not being used elsewhere you can commit it. Because it won't break the working application. Alternatively, let's say you are using a method
of a service file in controller, committed controller code, and didn't commit service file code. In this case when the controller action is used the application throws an error, which means code breaks.

Committing working code doesn't mean you have to commit a working feature. It just means whatever you are committing isn't breaking anything.

#### Diff your code

Before committing anything use your ide's diff tool or the integrated Git Version Control. Both VS Code and IntelliJ IDEA has their own diff tools. Make sure you don't commit debug logs, comments, or anything you wrote for your own convenience or testing changes.

#### Always Test your code

You already know you need to commit working code. But how do you make sure about that? For this, once you make changes test your changes thoroughly. Apart from testing your own changes, make sure changes you made to code didn't break some other feature. The best way to do is to trace the usage of your changes in other places using simple find feature of your ide, and then test that feature changes as well.

#### Avoid Committing passwords & secrets

One common mistake beginner developers do is committing API Keys, secrets, and passwords in the repository. Never commit them, this will create a security breach and some hackers misuse them to exploit your server resources. Never ever commit passwords, API keys, Secrets, or Bcrypt salts in the codebase.

### 4. Undoing Changes

#### What If You

- committed the wrong message?
- skipped file in the last commit?
- accidentally committed on master?
- accidentally committed to the wrong branch?
- want to undo the last 5 commits?
- want to undo changes to a file?
